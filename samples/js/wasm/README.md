# Demo of OpenVINOâ„¢ JS API usage

## Preparation

1. Build WASM package (see how to here: **TODO**)
1. Run `npm i` from *./src/bindings/js/common/*
1. Create symbolic links to WASM compilated part in *./src/bindings/js/common/dist/*
   As the result *dist* directory will contain *openvino_wasm.js* and *openvino_wasm.wasm* files
1. Run `npm link openvinojs` from *./src/bindings/js/common/*
1. Run `npm i` from *./samples/js/wasm/*
